# Stable Active-Model Discovery

Primary entries expose `x_ollama_router.display_name`: **Daytime (128K)** for `qwen3.8-27b-q8_0`, **Nighttime (32K)** for `qwen3.8-27b-abliterated-q6_k`. Clients use these labels for presentation while retaining canonical IDs in requests. The router dashboard and DSH discovery consume them; Open WebUI's alignment script persists them as model names.

The deployed primary catalog uses unrestricted output, unrestricted thinking and template-default effort. Its current policy, context recovery, durable archives and client behavior are defined in [Primary integration](PRIMARY_INTEGRATION.md). Legacy singleton-marker examples below are not primary production defaults.

Primary `output_policy` is `unrestricted`; `default_output_tokens` and `max_output_tokens` are null, `server_default_output_tokens` is -1, and enabled effort budgets are -1. Null must never be replaced with a client fallback or context-capacity default.

In **primary catalog mode**, `GET /v1/models` lists each canonical model exactly once, followed by a compatibility entry for `ROUTER_MODEL_ALIAS` (default `local-active`). This retains legacy clients that find the exact alias ID in `data`. `GET /v1/models/{id}` accepts canonical IDs and registered aliases. The compatibility entry equals its canonical target except for `id` and `x_ollama_router.alias: true`; context, concurrency, health, output policy, reasoning and capabilities are identical. Canonical entries retain `alias: false` and their `aliases` metadata. Other registered aliases remain available through metadata, detail lookup and inference.

The compatibility entry represents the same backend and admission slot. It does not add capacity, switch policy, or fall back to a different resident when unavailable. Catalog mode accepts canonical IDs, registered aliases, and an omitted model (the default), independently of the legacy broad-rewrite setting; unknown IDs return 404. Legacy single-marker behavior remains as documented below.

Pickers can omit `alias: true` entries when the corresponding `upstream_model` canonical entry exists; single-marker lists must retain their sole alias entry. Ollama `/api/tags` lists canonical entries; `/api/ps` lists healthy canonical residents; `/api/show` resolves a selected ID or alias. Admin overview and runtime state also remain canonical-only, so publishers and dashboards continue to count real residents. The list ETag covers the compatibility row as well as canonical metadata.

This discovery repair does not restore retired 128K/2 or 256K/1 capacity, a 32768-token output ceiling, or a medium router default. See the [Harness companion change request](HARNESS_PORTAL_COMPATIBILITY.md) for consumers that must distinguish complete unrestricted metadata from missing limits.

Public metadata remains schema v2, adding `health.available`, `health.status`, `aliases`, `artifact`, `revision`, `quantization`, `default_output_tokens`, `server_default_output_tokens`, and per-effort `reasoning_budget_tokens` (`-1` means no separate budget). Per-model metadata caches expire after the configured TTL (production: five seconds); reload invalidates both. Health does not change a model's qualified capabilities. No upstream URL, slot-control API, or admin token is exposed in public discovery.

The atomic marker is schema v3 with a `models` array, `default_model`, and a legacy coding projection at the root. See [Primary integration](PRIMARY_INTEGRATION.md). The rest of this document describes the retained **legacy single-marker mode**.


## Public alias

The router publishes one stable OpenAI-style model ID for its active slot. `ROUTER_MODEL_ALIAS` configures that ID and defaults to `local-active`. The alias is not an Ollama model copy, an installed-model catalog entry, or a model-management mechanism.

Requests naming the exact alias resolve to the active marker's physical model on:

- `POST /v1/responses` and `POST /responses`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `POST /api/chat` and `POST /api/generate`
- `POST /api/embed` and `POST /api/embeddings`
- `POST /api/show`

This exact-alias behavior is always active. `REWRITE_REQUESTED_MODEL_TO_ACTIVE=false` still rejects other mismatched model IDs according to the existing policy. Setting it to `true` retains the broader compatibility mode where arbitrary non-empty requested model IDs are advisory.

The alias is served on the normal router API listener with the same authentication posture as `/v1/responses`. It is not served on the separate admin listener.

## Endpoints

`GET /v1/models` returns exactly one public entry:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [MODEL_ENTRY]
}
```

`GET /v1/models/local-active` returns `MODEL_ENTRY` directly. A different ID returns HTTP 404 with an OpenAI-style `MODEL_NOT_FOUND` error. If there is no valid active model, both discovery forms return HTTP 503 with an OpenAI-style error whose code is `NO_ACTIVE_MODEL`; the router does not fabricate an entry.

Native Ollama discovery remains unchanged. For example, `/api/tags` may list every installed physical model and `/api/ps` may list running models. `/v1/models` never copies those catalogs.

## Model entry schema

Values below are illustrative. The physical model, limits, modalities, capabilities, and reasoning profile are derived at runtime; none are selected from a model-name table.

```json
{
  "id": "local-active",
  "object": "model",
  "created": 1788200000,
  "owned_by": "local-ai-ollama-router",
  "x_ollama_router": {
    "schema_version": 2,
    "alias": true,
    "upstream_model": "model-a:test",
    "profile": "example-profile",
    "updated_at": "2026-08-31T19:00:00.000Z",
    "context_window": 16384,
    "total_context_window": 32768,
    "context_safety_reserve": 1024,
    "model_context_window": 131072,
    "max_output_tokens": 2048,
    "input_modalities": ["text"],
    "capabilities": ["completion", "tools", "thinking"],
    "reasoning": {
      "supported": true,
      "efforts": {
        "off": "none",
        "minimal": "minimal",
        "low": "low",
        "medium": "medium",
        "high": "high",
        "xhigh": "xhigh",
        "max": "max"
      },
      "upstream_levels": ["low", "medium", "high"],
      "effort_map": {
        "minimal": "low",
        "low": "low",
        "medium": "medium",
        "high": "high",
        "xhigh": true,
        "max": true
      },
      "default": "medium"
    },
    "sources": {
      "active_model_marker": true,
      "ollama_ps": true,
      "ollama_show": true
    },
    "complete": true,
    "warnings": []
  }
}
```

Field semantics:

- `id` is always the configured alias. It remains stable when the active marker changes.
- `created` is the active marker update time as Unix seconds, falling back to marker mtime and then router start time when needed.
- `upstream_model` is the current physical Ollama model from the active-model source.
- `profile` and `updated_at` come from the marker and are `null` when absent or invalid.
- `context_window` is the effective limit clients should currently use. Precedence is the matching loaded model's positive `/api/ps` `context_length`, the marker's positive configured context, the reliable architectural context from `/api/show`, then `null`.
- `total_context_window` is the deployment-wide context allocation when the marker publishes one. It can span multiple request slots and is not the per-request admission limit.
- `context_safety_reserve` is the nonnegative token reserve that the router adds to every llama.cpp generation request during preflight admission. It defaults to `1024` for a llama.cpp marker and is `null` when the selected backend has no router-enforced formatted-context preflight. Clients can budget proactively with `formatted_input + requested_output + context_safety_reserve <= context_window`; the reserve is neither model context nor output capacity and must not be subtracted from `max_output_tokens` in isolation.
- `model_context_window` is only the architectural maximum reliably identified in `/api/show` `model_info`, normally using `general.architecture` and `<architecture>.context_length`. It is otherwise `null`.
- `max_output_tokens` is a positive value explicitly supplied by the marker. The router does not infer one from context size, architecture, or a model name; it is `null` when not configured.
- `input_modalities` combines explicit marker declarations with reported backend capabilities. `completion` adds `text`; `vision` adds `image`. For `llama_cpp`, the adapter reports `vision` only when the active marker sets `capability_profile.vision: true`; deployment marker generation must first verify the running server's `/props.modalities.vision`. The router never infers image support from a model or profile name.
- `capabilities` is the normalized capability array returned by `/api/show`. It is `null` when that source is unavailable; an explicitly reported empty array remains `[]`.
- `sources` reports which enrichment sources were usable for this entry. An environment fallback can supply an active physical model, but `active_model_marker` remains `false` because no marker supplied the metadata.
- `complete` is `false` when a source failed, a required part of its response was unavailable, or configured optional metadata was invalid. Optional values such as an unconfigured output limit may legitimately be `null` in an otherwise complete entry.
- `warnings` contains stable, payload-free diagnostic codes such as `OLLAMA_PS_UNAVAILABLE`, `OLLAMA_SHOW_UNAVAILABLE`, `OLLAMA_SHOW_CAPABILITIES_UNAVAILABLE`, or `INVALID_REASONING_CAPABILITIES`.

## Marker metadata

Existing markers remain valid. Discovery recognizes these optional canonical fields:

```json
{
  "model": "model-a:test",
  "profile": "example-profile",
  "context_length": 16384,
  "context_safety_reserve": 1024,
  "max_output_tokens": 2048,
  "input_modalities": ["text"],
  "default_think": "medium",
  "supported_think_levels": ["low", "medium", "high"],
  "reasoning_effort_map": {
    "minimal": "low",
    "low": "low",
    "medium": "medium",
    "high": "high",
    "xhigh": true,
    "max": true
  },
  "revision": "deployment-42",
  "updated_at": "2026-08-31T19:00:00.000Z"
}
```

For compatibility, marker context aliases already used by the dashboard (`context`, `num_ctx`, `numCtx`, and `options.num_ctx`) are also accepted. Output-limit aliases `maxOutputTokens`, `num_predict`, and `options.num_predict` are accepted, but the canonical names are preferred. `modalities` is accepted as an alias for `input_modalities`. `context_safety_reserve`, when present, must be a nonnegative integer; invalid values are ignored, reported as `INVALID_MARKER_CONTEXT_SAFETY_RESERVE`, and cause the llama.cpp admission guard and discovery entry to use the enforced default of `1024`.

Reasoning capability validation is shared with generation. `supported_think_levels` and `reasoning_effort_map` must appear together and satisfy the existing full-map validation. When valid, `reasoning.efforts` advertises the canonical Responses wire values, while `upstream_levels` and `effort_map` separately expose the actual Ollama negotiation. `off: "none"` documents the router's Responses control for disabling thinking. If safe reasoning support cannot be established, `supported` is `null` or `false`, unavailable upstream fields are `null`, and the router does not invent a mapping.

## Cache and freshness

Every discovery request re-reads the active-model source before consulting the enrichment cache. Cache entries are keyed by the physical model plus marker revision, mtime, update timestamp, and marker content digest. A marker change therefore invalidates the prior entry immediately, including changes that keep the same physical model but alter its limits or profile.

Successful or partial `/api/ps` and `/api/show` enrichment is cached for `ROUTER_MODEL_METADATA_TTL_MS`, default `5000` milliseconds. The cache never permits a prior physical model's entry to become the result after a newer marker revision has been detected. Discovery performs only `/api/ps` and `/api/show`; it does not generate, prewarm, pull, or load a model.

Responses include `Cache-Control: no-cache` and an `ETag` derived from the normalized public model entry. Send `If-None-Match` to revalidate; an unchanged entry returns HTTP 304 with no body.

## Partial metadata

A temporary `/api/ps` or `/api/show` failure does not erase valid marker data. The endpoint remains HTTP 200 while an active physical model exists, retains marker-supplied limits and reasoning metadata, marks the failed source `false`, sets unavailable fields to `null`, sets `complete` to `false`, and adds stable warnings.

Consumers must retain their last safe limits or choose conservative fallbacks when fields they require are missing. In particular, do not replace a known-safe context or output limit with an optimistic value merely because a partial response contains `null`.

## Examples

Fetch the one-entry catalog:

```bash
curl -i http://192.168.1.21:11434/v1/models
```

Fetch and save an ETag:

```bash
curl -i http://192.168.1.21:11434/v1/models/local-active
```

Revalidate a previously received entry:

```bash
curl -i http://192.168.1.21:11434/v1/models/local-active \
  -H 'If-None-Match: "previous-etag"'
```

Use the same stable ID for inference:

```bash
curl -fsS http://192.168.1.21:11434/v1/responses \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"local-active","input":"Reply with ok.","stream":false}'
```

## DeepSeek Harness consumer integration

This router publishes metadata; it does not automatically reconfigure DeepSeek Harness. Harness needs a separate consumer-side enhancement. That enhancement should:

- Configure only the stable router alias.
- Fetch `/v1/models/{alias}` at startup and when beginning a new request or session, using ETag revalidation.
- Apply `context_window`, `context_safety_reserve`, `max_output_tokens`, `input_modalities`, and reasoning metadata when present.
- Never persist `upstream_model` as the configured model ID.
- Retain the last safe values or fall back conservatively when metadata is incomplete.
- Refresh safely when a marker change causes the router to publish a new ETag and active physical model.
